# Chrono Helper

ChronoHelper is a free open-source tool for Unity Editor for controlling TimeScale in PlayMode with ease.  
It becomes very handy when it’s required to examine a suspicious moment of gameplay in slow-motion or conversely when it’s preferable to skip uninteresting part in fast-forward.
